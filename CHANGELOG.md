## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-03

Hotfix release. 0.1.5 shipped with a stale path in the CAP plugin entry — the package boot-crashes on `npm install` for any consumer.

### Fixed

- **`cds-plugin.js` references the pre-0.1.5 layout** (Blocker). The 0.1.5 packaging migration updated `package.json.main` from `dist/src/index.js` to `src/index.js`, but `cds-plugin.js` (a separate CAP plugin entry, not generated from TS) was missed and still required `./dist/src/plugin` — a path that no longer exists after the in-place build. Result: `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on every CAP startup. One-line fix to `require('./src/plugin')`.

### Maintenance

- `.gitignore`: ignore the in-place build artifacts (`src/**/*.js`, `src/**/*.d.ts`, `srv/**/*.js`, `srv/**/*.d.ts`) so they're shipped in the npm tarball but not tracked in git.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-03

Bugfix release covering four blocker/major issues that prevented a clean out-of-the-box experience after the 0.1.4 feature wave. No new features.

### Fixed

- **Packaging — `srv/admin-service` not loadable from a fresh install** (Blocker). Previous tarball shipped `srv/admin-service.ts` only; CAP's `@impl: '@odatano/watch/srv/admin-service'` couldn't resolve a `.js` file. Switched to in-place compilation via new `tsconfig.build.json` (`outDir: "."`). Now `srv/admin-service.js` ships alongside the source.
- **Packaging — `#cds-models/...` runtime require failed for consumers** (Blocker). Replaced `require('#cds-models/CardanoWatcherAdminService')` with literal relative path `require('../@cds-models/CardanoWatcherAdminService/index.js')`. `@cds-models/` directory now ships in the tarball. Consumers no longer need to mirror an `imports` field in their own `package.json`.
- **Koios endpoint `/credential_address` does not exist** (Blocker). `getAddressesByCredential` now hits `/credential_utxos` (the only Koios endpoint that returns addresses for a credential), dedups by `row.address`, and paginates via `Range` header. Caveat: returns only currently-unspent addresses — sufficient for credential watching's filter-set use case.
- **Hot script credentials triggered genesis-backfill stampede** (Major). `addWatchedAddress` / `addWatchedCredential` / `addWatchedPolicy` now default `lastCheckedBlock` to the current Blockfrost tip (was `null`, which made the first poll fetch from genesis). Hits Koios's pagination cap on creds with millions of historical txs (Minswap V2, etc.) are no longer the OOTB experience. Under Ogmios mode the cursor stays `null` so the chainSync-cap'd backfill can still run.
- **`backfill.ts` ESLint failure** — overengineered `infer _` conditional type replaced with direct type imports.

### Changed

- **Build pipeline**: `tsc` → `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`. New `build:typecheck` script runs the original (no-emit) tsc for IDE-style verification.
- **`package.json`**:
  - `main`: `dist/src/index.js` → `src/index.js`
  - `types`: `dist/src/index.d.ts` → `src/index.d.ts`
  - `files` array: explicit globs (`*.js`, `*.d.ts`, `*.cds`) instead of directory entries — strips `.ts` source from the published tarball (65 → 45 files).
- **TypeScript module resolution**: `moduleResolution: "node"` (deprecated alias) → `"node16"`. `module` aligned to `"node16"`. Two dynamic `import('./index')` calls in `src/plugin.ts` updated to `import('./index.js')`. Jest gains a `moduleNameMapper` to strip `.js` suffixes back to TS source for compile-on-the-fly tests.

### Breaking (semantic)

- **Watch-add no longer backfills history by default.** A freshly-added watch sees only forward activity (from the current Blockfrost tip onward). This is the corrected behavior — previous "default to genesis" caused the OOTB stampede. Consumers needing history can call `backfill.backfillAddress()` / `backfillCredential()` / `backfillPolicy()` programmatically, or PATCH the watch entity to set an earlier `lastCheckedBlock`.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-03

### Added

**Watch scopes**
- `WatchedCredential` entity (P1) — watch a payment credential across every bech32 derivative that shares it. Required for shared-script watching (Indigo CDP-manager, Minswap V2 pools, etc.). Backed by Koios for credential→addresses resolution.
- `WatchedPolicy` entity (P4) — watch a minting policy for mint/burn events. Suited to stablecoin/utility-token policies; high-asset NFT policies refused via `policyAssetCap` (default 100).

**Event payloads (P2 / P3 / P5)**
- `cardano.newTransactions` payload extended **in-place** with `tag`, `utxosCreated[]`, `utxosSpent[]`. UTxO entries carry `lovelace`, `assets[]`, and (when present) `inlineDatumHex` and `referenceScriptHash`.
- New event `cardano.credential.newTransactions` — same UTxO-rich shape, scoped to a payment credential.
- New events `cardano.policy.assetMinted` and `cardano.policy.assetBurned` — per-event semantics, payload `{ policyId, tag?, assetNameHex, quantity, txHash, blockHeight }`.
- All events carry an optional consumer-supplied `tag` for dispatch routing.

**Asset filter (P8)**
- `includesAssetsJson` column on `WatchedAddress` and `WatchedCredential`. JSON array of `{policyId, assetNameHex}`. Non-matching txs are skipped (cursor still advances). `addWatchedAddress` / `addWatchedCredential` accept the filter.
- Public helpers `parseAssetFilter`, `matchesAssetFilter`, type `AssetFilterEntry`.

**Coalesce window (P9)**
- `coalesceMs` column on `WatchedAddress` and `WatchedCredential` (1 – 300_000 ms). Bus events fire at most once per window with cumulative deltas; `BlockchainEvent` rows persist immediately. Tumbling-window semantics. `stopWatcher` flushes pending buffers.

**Replay API**
- New action `getEventsSince(scope, key, fromBlock?, limit?)`. `scope`: `'address' | 'credential' | 'policy'`. Returns persisted `BlockchainEvent` rows ordered by `blockHeight` ascending. Cursor pagination via `fromBlock` (exclusive); default limit 1000, hard cap 10_000.

**Phase 2 — Ogmios chainSync backend (`backend: 'ogmios'`)**
- `src/ogmios.ts` — chainSync wrapper with reconnect / exponential backoff, intersection negotiation.
- `src/ogmios-watcher.ts` — per-block filter pass: in-memory watch index (refreshed every 10 s), derives `WatchedUtxo` / mint / burn shapes from `Schema.Block`, persists `BlockchainEvent` rows tagged `backend: 'ogmios'` with `slot`, advances `WatcherCursor`.
- `src/backfill.ts` — Blockfrost-based one-shot history fetch on watch-add under Ogmios mode. Capped at the chainSync cursor's tip. Backfill rows tagged `backend: 'blockfrost'` so rollback never touches them.
- `RollBackward` handler: deletes `backend: 'ogmios'` rows past the rollback slot, recomputes per-watch `lastCheckedBlock`, drops pending coalesce buffers, emits `cardano.rollback { fromSlot, toSlot, affectedTxHashes }`.
- New entity `WatcherCursor` (single-row, id `'chainsync'`) persists chainSync state across restarts.

**Schema**
- `BlockchainEvent.slot` (Integer64, nullable) — populated by Ogmios backend.
- `BlockchainEvent.backend` (String) — `'blockfrost'` or `'ogmios'`. Scopes rollback to Ogmios rows only.
- `BlockchainEvent.address`, `.credential`, `.policy` associations for replay scope dispatch.
- `WatcherActionResult`, `WatcherBackend`, `PaymentCredHex`, `PolicyId`, `AssetNameHex` types.

**Configuration**
- `backend: 'blockfrost' | 'ogmios'` (default `'blockfrost'`).
- `ogmiosUrl: string` (default `'ws://localhost:1337'`); env fallback `OGMIOS_URL`.
- `koiosApiKey: string` (optional; env fallback `KOIOS_KEY`). Required only for credential watching.
- `credentialPolling`, `policyPolling` polling configs (off by default).
- `policyAssetCap: number` (default 100).

**Validators**
- `isPaymentCredHex`, `isPolicyId`, `isAssetNameHex`, `isAssetFilterJson`, `isCoalesceMs`, `isWatchScope`.

**Public types**
- `WatchedUtxo`, `SpentUtxoRef`, `WatchedAsset`, `PolicyAssetEvent`, `AssetFilterEntry`, `CredentialNewTransactionsEvent`, `PolicyAssetMintedEvent`, `PolicyAssetBurnedEvent`, `RollbackEvent`.

**Documentation**
- New **Event Delivery Contract** section in `ARCHITECTURE.md` — guarantees, non-guarantees, consumer guidance for state-machine handlers, replay patterns, coalesce+replay interaction.
- README rewritten ~600 → ~100 lines; full reference content lives in `docs/`.
- `QUICKSTART.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SETUP.md` refreshed for the current entity / event / action surface.

### Changed

- **Pagination correctness**: `getCredentialTxsSince` now paginates Koios via PostgREST `Range` headers (1000-row pages, 100k-row safety cap per poll). Previously silently dropped rows past the first page on busy credentials.
- **Pagination correctness**: `fetchPolicyAssetEvents` switched from `assetsHistory` (100-row default) to `assetsHistoryAll`. Previously truncated mint/burn history on high-velocity policies.
- `extractUtxoDeltas` signature: takes `Set<string>` of watched addresses (was a single string) so the credential watcher can pass every bech32 derivative at once. Address watchers wrap their single address.
- Polling section now describes four independent paths (address, transaction, credential, policy) instead of two.

### Fixed

- **Genesis cursor bug**: `processAddress` no longer treats `lastCheckedBlock = 0` or `null` as "no cursor". Fresh-added watches now actually fire on first poll; block 0 is honored as a real cursor.
- `fetchAddressTransactions` falsy-check fix: `if (fromBlock != null ...)` instead of `if (fromBlock ...)` to allow block 0.

### Known limitations

- **Ogmios backend has no `utxosSpent` detection:** Ogmios's `inputs` are outpoints, not (address + value). The polling backend continues to detect spends; switching to Ogmios is currently output-only.
- **`referenceScriptHash` not populated under Ogmios:** Ogmios delivers full script body; consumer can hash if needed.
- **Coalesce buffers not threaded through Ogmios chainSync emits** in this release — `coalesceMs` works under Blockfrost mode only.
- **`cardano.transactionConfirmed` event** declared in the public type surface but still not emitted; planned alongside Phase 2 follow-up work.
- **Backfill cap uses `getLatestBlock`** rather than slot→block translation. Rare overlap window with chainSync at the boundary; documented.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **CDS Model Auto-Discovery**: Plugin's CDS models (schema, admin service) were not loaded by consumer apps. CAP's `_link_required_services()` runs during env construction before `cds-plugin.js` loads, so the `model` array set on `cds.env.requires.kinds` was never merged into the requires entry. Fixed by setting `model` directly on `cds.env.requires['cardano-watcher']` in addition to the kind registration.
- **@impl Path Resolution**: `CardanoWatcherAdminService` used a relative `@impl` path (`srv/admin-service`) which CAP resolved against the consumer app root instead of the plugin package root, causing `Cannot find module` errors. Fixed by using the package-qualified path `@odatano/watch/srv/admin-service`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-22

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-19

### Changed
- Migrated to native CDS logger (`cds.log()`) instead of custom logger implementation
- Simplified API key configuration: `blockfrostApiKey` in config, `BLOCKFROST_KEY` env variable as fallback for development

### Removed
- Custom `logger.ts` utility (replaced by CDS logger)
- Unused configuration options: `blockfrostProjectId`, `batchSize`, `enableWebhooks`, `webhookEndpoint`

### Fixed
- **BREAKING**: Config key inconsistency - now consistently uses `cds.env.requires.watch` (previously mixed usage)
- Important: Configuration priority - CDS config always takes precedence over environment variables
- Consistent logger naming: unified to `ODATANO-WATCH`
